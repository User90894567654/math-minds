- Button spacing: px-4 py-2, px-6 py-3

**Grid Structure:**
- Sidebar: Fixed 280px width on desktop
- Main content: Flexible with max-width constraints
- Cards: 8px border radius, 4px spacing between elements

### D. Component Library

**Navigation Components:**
- Year level tabs: Pill-shaped buttons with active gradient states
- Topic cards: Clean cards with subtle shadows and hover states
- Answer type selector: Toggle buttons with clear visual feedback

**Question Interface:**
- Question cards: White background, subtle border, generous padding
- MCQ options: Grid layout with selectable button states
- Text inputs: Clean form fields with focus states
- Progress indicators: Linear progress bars with gradient fills

**XP & Gamification:**
- XP progress bar: Gradient fill with smooth animations
- Level badges: Circular badges with gradient backgrounds
- Achievement notifications: Modal overlays with celebration effects
- Stats dashboard: Card-based layout with key metrics

**Data Display:**
- Question counters: Pill badges with question counts
- XP multipliers: Color-coded indicators (MCQ=blue, Text=purple, Mixed=orange)
- Progress stats: Clean typography with visual hierarchy

### E. Responsive Behavior
**Mobile First Design:**
- Collapsible sidebar becomes bottom navigation on mobile
- Question cards stack vertically with full-width layout
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px height)
- Simplified XP display for smaller screens

**Desktop Enhancements:**
- Fixed sidebar with smooth scrolling question area
- Hover states for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Multi-column layouts where appropriate

### F. Animation Guidelines
**Minimal & Purposeful:**
- XP progress bar fills: Smooth 0.8s ease transitions
- Question loading: Subtle fade-in effects
- Level up celebrations: Brief confetti animation
- Tab switching: Quick 0.2s transitions
- Avoid distracting motion during learning sessions

### G. Accessibility Features
**Essential Requirements:**
- High contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader friendly markup and labels
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Alternative text for any iconography used

## Visual Hierarchy Strategy
1. **Primary Focus:** Current question and answer area
2. **Secondary:** XP progress and current stats
3. **Tertiary:** Navigation and topic selection
4. **Background:** Overall progress and achievements

## Motivational Design Elements
- Gradient progress bars to visualize XP growth
- Achievement badges with celebration micro-interactions
- Color-coded XP multipliers to encourage higher-value activities
- Clean, game-like interface that feels approachable rather than academic
- Visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers with appropriate colors

This design system balances educational functionality with engaging gamification elements, ensuring the app feels both professional and motivating for learners across all year levels.
